## Lance Miller

View this project [CodeSandbox](https://h8209j-4200.preview.csb.app/).

If you clone this repo locally, you will need to add your own `.env` file containing a `MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING` pointing to a MongoDB instance with a db called `"HugoChallenge"`.

## VIN Validation

The VIN fields are validated against a generic regular expression to ensure that it's formatted correctly. You can generate a random VIN from [Random VIN Generator](https://vingenerator.org/).
